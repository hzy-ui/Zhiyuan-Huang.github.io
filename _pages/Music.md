I love listening and playing music. 

I started learning electronic piano at the age of 4. 

And I picked up the acoustic guitar when I started my bachelor study (at 17).

I started playing electric guitar when I started my master's degree (at 21).

## Music
I love listening to different genres of music, including Blues, Jazz, R&B, Soul, Pop music, country music, etc.
