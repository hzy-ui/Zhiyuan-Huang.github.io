## At Xiamen University (From 2021 to now)




## At Qingdao University (From 2018 to 2021)
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working and collaborating with researchers at the [Institute for Future (IFF)](https://iff.qdu.edu.cn/index.htm#), led by Prof. [Shuzhi Sam Ge](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/). 
Moreover, the lab's advanced equipment, including robotic arms, 3D printers, AR/VR systems, drones, and SLAM robots, provided me with a remarkable opportunity for interdisciplinary learning. 
Those invaluable experiences allowed me to delve into the realms of robot control and machine learning, significantly enhancing my programming and English communication skills. 
Overall, those unique experiences ignited my enthusiasm for scientific research.
### Project 1
To address the factory's cloth transportation needs, we successfully developed autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) that efficiently transported materials to different stations. 
My primary responsibility in this project was to develop and debug the control algorithm based on sensing data, ensuring the smooth operation of the AGVs along a magnetic track.

### Project 2
We have designed an elevator climbing robot specifically aimed at detecting the misalignment of the guiderail. 
Additionally, we have developed effective methods for detecting misalignments using the robot.

### Acknowledgement
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the supervisors and collaborators during my time at the IFF. In particular, I would like to extend my special thanks to Dr. [Alireza Nemati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alireza-nemati-8116b390/), Prof. [Yinhua Liu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088988810), Prof. [Dongjie zhao](https://iff.qdu.edu.cn/info/1046/1082.htm), and Prof. [Wanyue Jiang](https://iff.qdu.edu.cn/info/1046/1081.htm). 

I also want to thanks the professor from the school of Automation, especially Prof. Jihui Zhang, Prof. Lin Zhao, Prof. Zhijian Ji, Prof. Zhongsheng Hou for helping me from bachelor till now.
