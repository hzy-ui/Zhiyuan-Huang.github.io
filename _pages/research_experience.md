## At Qingdao University (From 2018 to 2021)
<!-- During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working and collaborating with researchers at the [Institute for Future (IFF)](https://iff.qdu.edu.cn/index.htm#), led by Prof. [Shuzhi Sam Ge](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/). 
Moreover, the lab's advanced equipment, including robotic arms, 3D printers, AR/VR systems, drones, and SLAM robots, provided me with a remarkable opportunity for interdisciplinary learning. 
Those invaluable experiences allowed me to delve into the realms of robot control and machine learning, significantly enhancing my programming and English communication skills. 
Overall, those unique experiences ignited my enthusiasm for scientific research.
### * Project 1
To address the factory's cloth transportation needs, we successfully developed autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) that efficiently transported materials to different stations. 
My primary responsibility in this project was to develop and debug the control algorithm based on sensing data, ensuring the smooth operation of the AGVs along a magnetic track.

### * Project 2
We have designed an elevator climbing robot specifically aimed at detecting the misalignment of the guiderail. 
Additionally, we have developed effective methods for detecting misalignments using the robot.
